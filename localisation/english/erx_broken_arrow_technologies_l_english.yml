#Tier 1 Energy Gun
EUR_energy_equipment_1: "AER9 Laser Pistol"
EUR_energy_equipment_1_short: "AER9 Laser Pistol"
EUR_energy_equipment_1_desc: "The AER9 features a titanium housed crystal array which proved to withstand long years of exposure to the elements much better than the gold alloy housing of the later models. As a result, the crystal arrays stayed focused within operating parameters, rather than falling completely out of focus like the newer models. Power is drawn from microfusion cells and processed through a wave/particle diverter manufactured by General Atomics International."

#Tier 2 Energy Gun
EUR_energy_equipment_2: "AER9E3 Laser Rifle"
EUR_energy_equipment_2_short: "AER9 Laser Rifle"
EUR_energy_equipment_2_desc: "The standard issue laser rifle Pre-War, the AER9 features a features a titanium housed crystal array which proved to withstand long years of exposure to the elements compared to other top of the line models. While it was replaced by the YK42B pulse rifle before the Rig fell, we're not in a position to mass produce those rifles again. The AER9 itself if tough, reliable, and we are able to produce it in mass numbers as the standard issue energy weapon for frontline forces."

EUR_energy_equipment_3_desc: "Building off the success of the AER9, the A1 variant includes a rotating gyro to allow for fully automatic fire, whilst counter rotating gyros allow for a stable platform for firing. Weapon designers have considered this an improvement on even the Pre-War model, though it still remains a variant on the AER9. Combined with our expanded infantry kit this will considerably reduce the number of casualties our troops suffer."

#Tier 4 Energy Gun
EUR_energy_equipment_4: "AER9A2 Laser Rifle"
EUR_energy_equipment_4_short: "AER9A2 Laser Rifle"
EUR_energy_equipment_4_desc: "Refinement of all our previous upgrades have allowed for a more ergonomically designed model that does away with the obtuse rotating gyro for a smaller contained system housed within a titanium shell. Integration of pulse rifle breeder cell technology creates the most advanced laser energy weapon in the post-war era, suitable for the enclave. Combined with an infantry kit focused on energy weapons allows for even our auxiliary troops to dominate on the battlefield."
