The would be General hailing from far off Arcata did not have military service planned for his future, let alone in a military as spontaneous and incredulous as this new \"Federal Government\" He was drafted from his uneventful job as a general store clerk on the outskirts of his hometown to fight in the Navarro wars by the new administration and fought with distinction against both the Colonials and the Chinese throughout the course of the war. The rising casualty lists and a need for experienced command saw him being promoted to lieutenant Colonel by the conclusion of the 3rd war for Navarro. Following the formal annexation of these territories by the Federal Government the newly minted \"Brigadier General\" was uplifted alongside several others to help corral the territories and the swaths of fresh recruits from various tribes and counties."

EUR_BA_granite_desc: "Granite’s faith in the Enclave has long been tested, but with a final betrayal by Doctor Anderson it has finally shattered. The Enclave has betrayed the American People for the last time. The future is at hand, and it won't be written by the likes of the purists. To find the true way forward, Granite and his followers have looked back to what came before. The vision and framework set forth by the Founding Fathers and those great Americans who followed. With God as his witness... Granite and the American people will be free...\n\n§ROr Die In The Attempt.§!"

This competence and wit in battle, and what can be considered \"Governance\", is like no other mutant, save one. §!\n\n§RAttis§!\n\n§gLike the great confidant and general of the Master's armies, the First has swept over all who oppose him and has proven a competent leader of both mutant and man. With the many tribals of Oregon considering him a God, they have pledged their fealty and lives to his cause. What that cause is remains to be seen, but if the whispers of his subordinates and followers bear any truth, the first may just yet claim the title so sought by all mutants before him...§!\n\n§0\"The New Master.\"§!"
