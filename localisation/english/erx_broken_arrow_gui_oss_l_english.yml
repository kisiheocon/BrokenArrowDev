The OSS was formed as an agency of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to coordinate espionage activities behind enemy lines for all branches of the United States Armed Forces. Other OSS functions included the use of propaganda, subversion, and post-war planning.\n\nCurrent Target: §Y[erx_ba_gui_oss_GetCurrentTargetName]§!\n\n[erx_ba_gui_oss_GetCurrentTargetDesc]\n"

erx_ba_oss_target_1_name: "[NCR.GetFlag] New California Republic"
erx_ba_oss_target_1_desc: "§L\"The Rich Will Get What They Want, The Poor Will Lose What They Need.\"§!\n\nThe §L\"New California Republic\"§! a farrago of inspirations and ideas hobbled together only decades ago out of the ruins of the west coast. Dominated by former vault dwellers this state has grown from a minor regional point of interest to a powerhouse that is in a fierce battle for domination of the west with the §g[BOS.GetNameWithFlag]§!. In this ever troublesome contest for power and influence the Republic has conquered or Shanghaied neighboring states and territories into its borders. This most recently being demonstrated by their march on Hoover Dam and subsequent victory over §R[CES.GetNameWithFlag]§!.\n\nInternally however, The young republic is anything but a powerhouse, or even a refuge for democracy. It is nothing but a corrupt state. More rife with poverty, civil strife and political disenchantment then freedom or prosperity. Its congress, once a symbol of liberty and democracy. Has been bastardized and trampled in a crusade by criminal and corrupt elements to tarnish whatever good will the Republic had left. And in fact it seems the only thing that their leaders can agree on is the witch hunt against those who still would defend this once great and illustrious nation. Regardless of age or innocence. Even while their people starve and rot they hunt us down like rats in the street. But the memories of our brothers and sons hanging from a republic noose, drawn and quartered like dogs is something we will never forgive. Or ever forget. And make no mistake, those responsible will pay for their crimes.\n\n§4\"And We Will Not Be So Merciful.\"§!"

erx_ba_oss_target_3_name: "[BOS.GetFlag] Brotherhood of Steel"
erx_ba_oss_target_3_desc: "§g\"In The West Shall Rise, A Sinister Creed.\"§!\n\nThe §g\"Brotherhood Of Steel\"§!, once a respected and reputable collective of military units stationed and tasked with garrisoning in the ever enigmatic Mariposa Military Base. Soon following the initiation of Atomic exchanges between The United States and Bolshevik China revolted. Deserting their country and values as a result of supposed \"Unethical Experimentation\" by the base's science wing. They then spent the aftermath of the Great war either converting remnants of military units across the west coast or eradicating those still remaining loyal to their country.\n\nThey have utilized the last two hundred years wisely. Spreading across the Continental United States like a plague, tearing through the land and confiscating technology from the population wherever they find it. Tormenting an already battered and defeated people. Hiding from justice and retaliation in their bunkers at Lost Hills, whilst leaving those who they deem unworthy to rot and fester in the ruins that they leave behind. Tarnishing the legacy of the country that they trample over with tyranny and despotic arrogance.\n\nTaking down this armoured menace is a tall order. But with God as our witness we must. And so we shall.\n\n§4\"Their Days Are Numbered\"§!"

erx_ba_oss_target_6_name: "[VIC.GetFlag] New Victoria"
erx_ba_oss_target_6_desc: "§t\"There's Another Country I Heard Of Long Ago\"§!\n\n§t[VIC.GetNameWithFlag]§! was once just a minor outlying island on the edge of British Canada, a mere footnote for those on their way to greener pastures in Alaska or inner Canada. But as fate would have it, God had intended more for this little strip of land on the Pacific coast. In the midst of the Great Catastrophe of 2077, as anarchy and atomic hellfire tore through the world like a scythe, this little-known and little-cared-for isle, in a matter of moments, became the most important place in modern Canadian history. As the rest of the occupied nation fell into disarray and chaos, the government, elements of the military, and a swath of civilians soon called this previously sparsely populated island home. From the shattered remnants of Canada's government and leading politicians rose something even more surprising: the House of Victoria.\n\nThis House, formed out of desperation and the sheer will of an empire long dead, brought order and discipline to the collapsing isle, preventing its fall to piracy and anarchy like that suffered by their countrymen on the mainland. And there it stood for nearly two centuries, fending off piracy and biding its time, waiting for the opportunity to claim its birthright and retake the mainland.\n\nDespite constant assaults by pirates and criminals, the Victorian isle, armed and guarded by the Royal Fleet, refuses to come to terms. But the strength of their fleet is waning, and the tides of war are ever tumultuous. With the rise of new powers like the §1[WBH.GetNameWithFlag]§! and the pirate confederation under the §B[BRK.GetNameWithFlag]§!, this lone isle will have to fight harder than it ever has, lest it be caught and sunk beneath the waves of war.\n\nBut all is not lost. Across the sea to the south, another power rises, one dedicated to freedom and liberty, led by a man with a heart of Granite. Perhaps a future for this continent is indeed possible.\n\nWhatever the future holds, the Victorians gird themselves. In this new and troublesome age, if the last embers of Britannia are to be washed away, they will end just as violently as they began: defending their ancient rights and values to the bitter end.\n\n§4\"God Save the Empire.\"§!"
