The OSS was formed as an agency of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to coordinate espionage activities behind enemy lines for all branches of the United States Armed Forces. Other OSS functions included the use of propaganda, subversion, and post-war planning.\n\nCurrent Target: §Y[erx_ba_gui_oss_GetCurrentTargetName]§!\n\n[erx_ba_gui_oss_GetCurrentTargetDesc]\n"

erx_ba_oss_target_1_name: "[NCR.GetFlag] New California Republic"
erx_ba_oss_target_1_short_desc: "§LTaxes are cringed.§!"
erx_ba_oss_target_1_desc: "§L\"The Rich Will Get What They Want, The Poor Will Lose What They Need.\"§!\n\nThe §LNew California Republic§! is a stitched together experiment in Old World nostalgia, Vaultborn idealism wrapped around Shady Sands' ambition, now swollen into a regional titan that postures as the wasteland's \"only democracy\". Through conquest, coercion, and convenient \"statehood\", the Bear has dragged neighboring communities into its orbit, projecting power outward while selling the story that its expansion is simply order winning over chaos. In recent years, that outward march has only accelerated, and the Republic carries itself like a nation destined to inherit not only the West, but the East as well, whether they agree or not.\n\nBut intelligence paints a colder picture behind the flags and speeches. Their President, Kimball, still stung by humiliations and setbacks, has been willing to play dirty in the north, leveraging backchannels and alliances of convenience to tighten a political noose around rivals and frontier territories.\n\nThe Republic's influence does not travel only by ranger patrol and senate decree; it rides on the Big Circle and Little Loop, long-running clandestine routes used to move arms, munitions, and people wherever Shady Sands needs leverage. The Fourways have been their entrance into the north.\n\nThe Bear smiles in public, then sharpens its claws in private.\n\nInternally, the Republic is not the refuge it advertises. It is a marketplace of power where wealth speaks clearly and the poor are expected to listen quietly. Corruption festers in the machinery of governance, and the \"rule of law\" functions as a tool often aimed downward. In the north, reports describe a brutal system of prison and labor camps, where the NCR's enemies, undesirables, and inconvenient voices are worked to the bone under a warden known only as The Investor, who reportedly relies on extortion and slave labor with minimal restraint.\n\nA republic can survive hardship, but it cannot survive becoming a brand, something sold by the powerful while the rest pay the bill in blood and silence. We will see to it that those responsible will pay for their crimes.\n\n§4\"And We Will Not Be So Merciful.\"§!"

erx_ba_oss_target_3_name: "[BOS.GetFlag] Brotherhood of Steel"
erx_ba_oss_target_3_short_desc: "§LKnight LARPers.§!"
erx_ba_oss_target_3_desc: "§g\"In The West Shall Rise, A Sinister Creed.\"§!\n\nThe §gBrotherhood of Steel§! began as a remnant of Pre-War military authority that survived the Great War with its discipline intact, and its conscience conveniently rewritten. Born from the bunkers and the black halls of places like Mariposa, the Brotherhood built its identity around a single, self-justifying doctrine: Technology must be controlled, and the people of the wastes cannot be trusted to possess it. In practice, that \"protection\" looks like confiscation, intimidation, and the cold, paternal certainty that anyone outside their order is either a threat, a child, or a future corpse. Their power is not theoretical. Their most powerful, and closest, chapter is headquartered at Lost Hills, and remains a major regional force even after suffering setbacks against the NCR, retaining the rare ability to field Vertibirds and deploy Power Armor at scale, a capability most factions can only fear or imitate.\n\nInternally, the Brotherhood is not a republic, and it is not a meritocracy, it is an insulated machine that worships its own continuity. Governance runs through an oligarchic Council of Elders, led by a High Elder, directing policy and command from behind ritual, hierarchy, and a language of duty that conveniently excuses domination of any land unlucky enough to fall under their control. They also have secondary chapters dictated not by the Council of Elders, but rather a singular Elder, who can take or disobey orders from the Council on a whim.\n\nTheir knowledge monopoly is enforced by the castes that keep the order alive: The Scribes who catalog, experiment, and hoard recovered technology and data, turning every battlefield into a salvage operation and every ruin into a shrine. The Knights, who take the information the Scribes research and, on occasion create, by themselves, and put it to use through destructive patrols and combat encounters, and the Paladins, who are only focused on internal and external leadership and command, ensuring the Knights and Scribes know their place.\n\nOrders flow through the \"Chain that Binds\", a structure designed off America's own Armed Forces before the War, corrupted by them to ensure obedience over accountability. Because in Brotherhood doctrine, the only thing more dangerous than civilian access to technology is the possibility of civilian choice.\n\nYet even tyrannies have vulnerabilities, and the Brotherhood has made enemies wherever its boots have tread. Many in the West view them as arrogant, invasive, and endlessly self-righteous, while others, bafflingly, still romanticize them as armored saviors. That split is precisely what makes them dangerous: Their myth travels faster than their columns, and their propaganda fills the gaps their governance cannot. \n\nTo confront the Brotherhood is not merely to fight soldiers in metal, it is to fight a creed that claims virtue while building a world where only they are permitted to inherit the future.\n\n§4\"Their Days Are Numbered.\"§!"

erx_ba_oss_target_5_name: "[SHI.GetFlag] Shi"
erx_ba_oss_target_5_short_desc: "§LChinese on American soils?§!"
erx_ba_oss_target_5_desc: "Following the Great War of 2077, and several decades of chaos and violence, San Francisco and its surrounding regions fell under the control of a group calling themselves the \"Shi\" manned by Chinese immigrants alongside a significant number of Communist Chinese operatives, sailors and soldiers from throughout the east coast. All led by the Emperor. An enigmatic character with little to no information known. Regardless the Shi have consolidated their holdings in recent years. And now act as a regional power broker on the west coast. How we deal with them will surely shape the future of this region."

erx_ba_oss_target_6_name: "[VIC.GetFlag] New Victoria"
erx_ba_oss_target_6_short_desc: "§LMonarchy of a bygone era.§!"
erx_ba_oss_target_6_desc: "§t\"There's Another Country I Heard Of Long Ago\"§!\n\n§tNew Victoria§! was once just a minor outlying island on the edge of British Canada, a mere footnote for those on their way to greener pastures in Alaska or inner Canada. But as fate would have it, God had intended more for this little strip of land on the Pacific coast. In the midst of the Great Catastrophe of 2077, as anarchy and atomic hellfire tore through the world like a scythe, this little-known and little-cared-for isle, in a matter of moments, became the most important place in modern Canadian history. As the rest of the occupied nation fell into disarray and chaos, the government, elements of the military, and a swath of civilians soon called this previously sparsely populated island home. From the shattered remnants of Canada's government and leading politicians rose something even more surprising: the House of Victoria.\n\nThis House, formed out of desperation and the sheer will of an empire long dead, brought order and discipline to the collapsing isle, preventing its fall to piracy and anarchy like that suffered by their countrymen on the mainland. And there it stood for nearly two centuries, fending off piracy and biding its time, waiting for the opportunity to claim its birthright and retake the mainland.\n\nDespite constant assaults by pirates and criminals, the Victorian isle, armed and guarded by the Royal Fleet, refuses to come to terms. But the strength of their fleet is waning, and the tides of war are ever tumultuous. With the rise of new powers like the Washington Brotherhood and the pirate confederation under the Broken Coast, this lone isle will have to fight harder than it ever has, lest it be caught and sunk beneath the waves of war.\n\nBut all is not lost. Across the sea to the south, another power rises, one dedicated to freedom and liberty, led by a man with a heart of Granite. Perhaps a future for this continent is indeed possible.\n\nWhatever the future holds, the Victorians gird themselves. In this new and troublesome age, if the last embers of Britannia are to be washed away, they will end just as violently as they began: defending their ancient rights and values to the bitter end.\n\n§4\"God Save the Empire.\"§!"
