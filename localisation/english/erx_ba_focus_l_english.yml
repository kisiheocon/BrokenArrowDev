erx_ba_navarro_shi_start: "The Affairs Of San Francisco"
erx_ba_navarro_shi_start_desc: "Following the Great War of 2077, and several decades of chaos and violence, San Francisco and its surrounding regions fell under the control of a group calling themselves the \"Shi\" manned by Chinese immigrants alongside a significant number of Communist Chinese operatives, sailors and soldiers from throughout the east coast. All led by the Emperor. An enigmatic character with little to no information known. Regardless the Shi have consolidated their holdings in recent years. And now act as a regional power broker on the west coast. How we deal with them will surely shape the future of this region."

erx_ba_navarro_shi_lose_0_desc: "We have been dealt a degrading defeat at the hands of settlers and Imperial Chinese ground forces. Our ground forces have been completely overrun and the south has been relegated to a complete rout. President Granite has ordered the immediate withdrawal of our forces from our southern border and we have been sent reeling by a peoples and by forces we deemed inferior. This is a dark and bitter day for the Republic.\n\n\"It Will Unlikely Be The Last\""

erx_ba_navarro_shi_lose_treaty_desc: "The terms have been demanded, they have been set, and are now indisputable. Or so the Emperor and his minions would have us believe. We may have been beaten on the field, but we have not been defeated. During the day, our legal and espionage experts meticulously scan every inch of the treaty for loopholes and flaws. During the night, partisans and disenfranchised citizens loyal to the Federal Government strike the Emperor's \"Peacekeepers\" and any who aid them. Our authority in the region may have been torn asunder, but our ideals have never been stronger. But despite this fact, these efforts are disorganized and chaotic, leaving their long-lasting effects as questionable at best. Our efforts need a unified command figure in the field, and we know just the man..."
